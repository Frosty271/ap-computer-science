WH Taft High School 13-14

Assignments and explorations from the year. Includes [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project files ([guide for getting IntelliJ setup for APCS](http://blog.nickswalker.com/post/60590956718/using-intellij-for-ap-computer-science)). Some may be replicated in Objective-C for kicks. Be sure to include GridWorld as a dependency in any project that needs it.

## Labs

### Text Labs

Console based labs.

#### Text Lab 1

Prints simple ASCII art from passed in arrays of "pixels."

#### Text Lab 2

Takes an input number of milliseconds and splits it into component time units. Good practice with modulo math.

#### Text Lab 3

#### Text Lab 4

Implements a class for storing rational numbers and a helper class for simplification.

#### Text Lab 5

Extends Text Lab 4 with arithmetic ability.

#### Text Lab 6

Calculates cost of mortgage loans.

#### Text Lab 7

Generates Magic Squares using two different methods. Includes built in checking mechanisms and string output.

### Graphics Labs

Graphics applets.

#### Graphics Lab 1

Displays various shapes using built in drawing methods.

#### Graphics Lab 2

Displays parabolas using straight lines.

## Other Projects

### Review

Contains classes with simplest-case demonstrations for various important areas of programming.

#### Data Types

Data types in the AP Computer Science Java Subset.

#### Control Structures

Control structures in the AP Computer Science Java Subset.

### Input Helper

Simple wrapper for Scanner input methods.

### Fitter

Takes a given quantity of two specific integers and determines whether it is possible to reach a certain number exactly by using only the allotted possible integer addends.

### Primes

Takes an input number and determines whether it is prime or not using simple trial algorithm.and Obj-C (iOS interface).

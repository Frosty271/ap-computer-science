WH Taft High School 13-14

Assignments and explorations from the year. Includes [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project files. Some may be replicated in Objective-C for kicks. Be sure to include GridWorld as a dependency in any project that needs it.

## Labs

###Text Lab 1

Prints simple ASCII art from passed in arrays of "pixels." 

## Other Projects

### Control Structures

Simplest-case demonstrations for the control structures in the AP Computer Science Java Subset.

### Primes

Takes an input number and determines whether it is prime or not using simple trial algorithm. In Java and Obj-C (iOS interface).

### Time

Takes an input number of seconds and splits it into component days, hours, and minutes. Good practice with modulo math. In Java.
